# Solving cancer

## Cancer biology

What do we need to know about a cancer to stop it?

1. Metastasis
    - What features enable a cell to colonize new tissue?
        - Can we target those features to stop the colonization process with minimal toxicity?
2. Cancer biomarkers
    - How can we distinguish cancer cells from normal cells?
    - Can we do so _in vivo_ (e.g. with CAR-T cells)?
    - Can we do so from the surfaceome (i.e. without knowledge of intracellular processes)?
3. Etiology
    - What are the causative agents of cancer?
    - How can we eliminate our exposure to those carcinogens?

## Effector functions

What technical capabilities do we need to engineer the "perfect" treatment?

- Synthetic motility
- Synthetic protein and small molecule sensors (e.g. allosteric transcription factors)
- Epigenome readers and writers
