# The fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family

- FGFs are secreted glycoproteins
- 18 mammalian FGFs[^beenken2009]
    - FGF1 through FGF10
    - FGF16 through FGF23
- Six subfamilies (groups)
    1. 1, 2
    2. 3, 7, 10, 22
    3. 4, 5, 6
    4. 8, 17, 18
    5. 9, 16, 20
    6. 19, 21, 23
    7. **fibroblast homologous factors (FHFs)**: 11-14 (high sequence identity with FGF members but do not activate FGFRs and are therefore not considered members of the FGF family, i.e. pseudogenes), FGF15 (mouse ortholog of human FGF19)
- groups 1-5 are paracrine
- group 6 is endocrine and relies on **Klotho proteins** ($\alpha$Klotho and $\beta$Klotho) to bind to their receptors

## The general FGF/FGFR signalling system

### FGFs

- signal peptides
    - groups 2, 3, 4, and 6 have signal peptides
    - group 5 is still secreted through the ER-Golgi pathway
    - group 1 is secreted independently[^nickel2005]
- FGFs have homologous core region of 120-130 amino acids
    - core forms **12 antiparallel $\beta$-strands** ($\beta$1-$\beta$12)
- N- and C-termini are divergent
    - primary sequence variation of the termini account for the different biology of the ligands
- **heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan (HSGAG) binding site (HBS)** within the FGF core is composed of the $\beta$1-$\beta$2 loop and parts of region spanning $\beta$10-$\beta$12
    - forms a contiguous, positively charged surface
    - subfamily 6 contains ridges that reduce HSGAG binding to the core, leading to the endocrine nature of the subfamily
    - FGFs are readily sequestered by the ECM by **heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs)**
        - FGFs are released from the ECM by heparinases, proteases, or specific FGF binding proteins

### FGFRs
- four functional mammalian FGFRs
    - FGFR1
    - FGFR2
    - FGFR3
    - FGFR4
    - FGFR5 (=FGFRL1): no tyrosine kinase domain; may function as negative regulator of FGF signalling
