# The fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family

- 18 mammalian FGFs[^beenken2009]
    - FGF1 through FGF10
    - FGF16 through FGF23
- Six subfamilies (groups)
    1. 1, 2
    2. 3, 7, 10, 22
    3. 4, 5, 6
    4. 8, 17, 18
    5. 9, 16, 20
    6. 19, 21, 23
    7. unassigned: 11-14 (high sequence identity with FGF members but do not activate FGFRs and are therefore not considered members of the FGF family, i.e. pseudogenes), FGF15 (mouse ortholog of human FGF19)
- groups 1-5 are paracrine
- group 6 is endocrine and relies on **Klotho proteins** ($\alpha$Klotho and $\beta$Klotho)
