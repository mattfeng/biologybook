# The fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family

- 18 mammalian FGFs[^beenken2009]
    - FGF1 through FGF10
    - FGF16 through FGF23
- Six subfamilies
    - 1, 2
    - 3, 7, 10, 22
    - 4, 5, 6
    - 8, 17, 18
    - 9, 16, 20
    - 19, 21, 23
    - unassigned: 11-14 (high sequence identity with FGF members but do not activate FGFRs and are therefore not considered members of the FGF family, i.e. pseudogenes), FGF15 (mouse ortholog of human FGF19)
